# Ideas

There are many aspects you could contribute:
*	Looking for different sections.
    - The programs works reasonably well, but it still is unable to find the sections in some papers due to the inconsistency in XML labelling across journals. 
*	Detection of citations not accompanied by a formal citation in that same sentence such as “as reported in Author et al, …”
*	Extend this investigation to study how the sections in which a paper is cited changes over time.
*	Analyses of retraction notes to produce two sets of papers: those criticizing an article (on which the retraction is based on) and those citing in a neutral way (including those published before the more critical ones)
*	Your ideas here.
